ar:033,skos:Concept,Architecture Requirements Repository,"The Architecture Requirements Repository is used by all phases of the Architecture Development Method (ADM) to record and manage all information relevant to the architecture requirements. The requirements address the many types of architecture requirements; i.e., strategic, segment, and capability requirements which are the major drivers for the Enterprise Architecture. Requirements can be gathered at every stage of the architecture development lifecycle and need to be approved through the various phases and governance processes. The Requirements Management phase is responsible for the management of the contents of the Architecture Requirements Repository and ensuring the integrity of all requirements and their availability for access by all phases.",ar:001,,ar:scheme,https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/index.html,,,

ar:038,skos:Concept,Solution Building Block,"The building blocks may be products or services which may be categorized according to the Enterprise Continuum categorization and/or the ABB specifications as Strategic, Segment, or Capability SBBs. SBBs may also include tools, systems, services, and information which describe the actual solutions that may be selected and their operation. For example, vendor-specific reference models or vendor-specific levels 4 and 5 of the IT4IT Reference Architecture would be defined here. However, the Solutions Landscape will not include the information and data content produced by the solutions selected; that is the responsibility of the solutions themselves.",ar:037,,ar:scheme,https://pubs.opengroup.org/architecture/togaf9-doc/arch/index.html,,,
